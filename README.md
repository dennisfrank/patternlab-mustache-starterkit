# Custom StarterKit for Mustache by Dennis Frank

The Custom StarterKit for Mustache is a customized version of [Pattern Labâ€™s Base StarterKit for Mustache](https://github.com/pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-base) and meant to be used as a near-blank starting point for my projects.

## Requirements

The Base StarterKit for Mustache requires the following PatternEngine:

* `pattern-lab/patternengine-mustache`: [documentation](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-mustache#mustache-patternengine-for-pattern-lab), [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-mustache), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/patternengine-mustache)

## Install

This StarterKit can be installed via one of the following commands:

    php core/console --starterkit --init
    php core/console --starterkit --install pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-base

It is recommended that you **do not** install this StarterKit as a dependency for your Pattern Lab project via Composer.

## Edit Files

After installation the files for this StarterKit can be found in `source/`.
